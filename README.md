## Getting Started
To get started with this Apollo GraphQL Server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LAYTHJABBAR/profit-Back-end.git mynewbackend

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mynewbackend
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure your environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The server will be running locally at `http://localhost:4000`. You can access the GraphQL Playground to interact with the API.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.js`: The entry point of the server.
- `graphql/`: Contains GraphQL schema and resolvers.
- `models/`: Defines MongoDB models using Mongoose.
- `config/`: Configuration files and environment variables.
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware for the server.
- `utils/`: Utility functions.
- `tests/`: Test files (not included in this project).

## Available Scripts
- `npm start`: Start the production server.
- `npm run dev`: Start the development server with nodemon for auto-reloading.
- `npm test`: Run tests (you need to create your own test suite).

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following dependencies, which are defined in the `package.json` file:

- `apollo-server`: Apollo Server for GraphQL implementation.
- `dotenv`: Environment variable management.
- `graphql`: GraphQL query language and runtime.
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool.
- `nodemon`: Utility that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the server.

Make sure to check the `package.json` file for the exact versions used in this project.
